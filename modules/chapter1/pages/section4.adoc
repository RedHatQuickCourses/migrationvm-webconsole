= What is the lab setup in the exercise?

The lab environment has three machines:

* `workstation`: acts as a exporting Network File System (NFS) server.
* `servera`: acts as the source host machine for the VM.
* `serverb`: acts as the destination host machine to live-migrate the VM.

Both `servera` and `serverb` to be setup with a shared storage pool and a shared volume.
