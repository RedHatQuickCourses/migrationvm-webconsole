= Guided Exercise: Guided solution

Create a virtual machine and live migrate it using the web console.

*Outcomes*

 - Live-migrate a virtual machine (VM) from servera to serverb.

As the `student` user on the `workstation` machine, use the lab command to prepare your environment for this exercise, and to ensure that all required resources are available.

 [student@workstation ~]$ lab start migration-cockpit

*Instructions*

. Configure shared storage for `servera` and `serverb`.
 .. Verify the NFS export on the `workstation` machine. The workstation machine is configured as a NFS server by the `lab start` command you ran in the preceding step.
 

        [student@workstation ~]$ sudo exportfs
        [sudo] password for student:
        /mnt          	<world>
        
 .. Open a new terminal to `workstation` and log in to `servera`. Mount the shared directory on the source machine (`servera`).
 ... Use the sudo password `student` whenever required.

        [student@workstation ~]$ ssh servera
        [student@servera ~]$ sudo -i
        [sudo] password for student:
        [root@servera ~]# mount workstation:/mnt /mnt
        [root@servera ~]# mount | grep workstation
        workstation:/mnt on /mnt type nfs4 ...
 
 ... The last command verifies that the mount is successful.

.. Open a new terminal to `workstation` and log in to `serverb`. Mount the shared directory on the destination machine (`serverb`).
... Use the sudo password `student` whenever required.

        [student@workstation ~]$ ssh serverb
        [student@serverb ~]$ sudo -i
        [sudo] password for student:
        [root@serverb ~]# mount workstation:/mnt /mnt
        [root@serverb ~]# mount | grep workstation
        workstation:/mnt on /mnt type nfs4 ...

... The last command verifies that the mount is successful.

. Add secondary hosts on the RHEL web console
.. Switch to the `workstation` terminal and enable the service for the RHEL web console.

        [student@workstation ~]$ sudo -i
        [sudo] password for student:
        [root@workstion ~]# systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket

.. Visit the GNOME login screen on the `workstation` machine. Click the `student` user account. Enter student when prompted for the password.

.. Navigate to `https://localhost:9090` to access the RHEL web console on the Firefox browser.

... The Add new host dialog appears.
... In the Add new host dialog, configure the following properties and *click Add*.
    
    Host: servera
    User name: student
+
image::2.7.3.png[float="center",align=center]

.. Add `serverb` as another secondary host in the similar way.
 
        Host: serverb
        User name: student
+
image::2.8.png[float="center",align=center]

.. Verify both `servera` and `serverb` got added successfully by *clicking on their names* in the left pane. You can see details of `servera` and `serverb` after clicking on them.
+

. Create a storage volume on servera.
.. Switch to `servera` by clicking the down-arrow in the left pane and click `servera`.
.. Click *Turn on administrative access* on `servera`. Enter the password `student` when prompted and click *Authenticate*.
+
image::3.2.png[float="center",align=center]
.. Switch to the *terminal* to start and enable the *libvirtd* service on `servera` and `serverb`.

 [root@servera ~]# systemctl enable --now libvirtd
 Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/libvirtd.service → /usr/lib/systemd/system/libvirtd.service.
 ...output omitted...

 [root@serverb ~]# systemctl enable --now libvirtd
 Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/libvirtd.service → /usr/lib/systemd/system/libvirtd.service.
 ...output omitted...

.. Refresh the web page (web console) in Firefox browser to reflect the changes.
+
 Note: The Virtual Machines option on the sidebar is visible on servera and serverb because the cockpit-machines package is installed on both servera and serverb.
 This installation was done when you ran the lab start migration-cockpit script at the beginning of this exercise.
 You do not see the Virtual Machines option on the workstation web console as this package is not installed on it.

.. Navigate to *Virtual Machines → Storage pools*. Click *Create storage pool*.
...Enter the details as given in the following table:
+
|===========================
|Name	|migration-test
|Type	|Network file system
|Target |path	/mnt/
|Host	|workstation
|Source |path	/mnt
|===========================

... *Click Create*.
+
image::3.5.png[float="center",align=center]
... Make sure to use the same names as given in the instructions for a successful grading at the end of the exercise.

.. Click *Activate*. This button starts the inactivate storage pool.
.. Add a storage volume in the `migration-test` storage pool.
... Click the down-arrow key and click the *Storage volumes* tab. Click *Create volume*.
+

.. On `servera`, Click *Virtual machines* breadcrumb.
+
image::4.1.png[float="center",align=center]

.. Click *1 Network*.
.. Verify that you have a network named `default`. Click the down-arrow to expand the details and review them. Do not make any changes.
+
image::4.3.png[float="center",align=center]

... You use this network to create the VM in a later step.

.. Switch to `serverb`, click *Turn on administrative access*. Enter the password student and click *Authenticate*.
... Navigate to *Virtual machines → 1 Network* to view the same default network. Verify that the network is in active state. Do not make any other changes.
... The source and destination must have identical network for the migration to succeed.

. Set the required SElinux contexts on the shared volume.
.. Run the following commands on `servera` so that SElinux allows the virsh utility to access the shared volume for the VM creation.
 
 [root@servera ~]# semanage fcontext -a -t virt_image_t '/mnt/migration-volume'
 [root@servera ~]# restorecon -v '/mnt/migration-volume'
 [root@servera ~]# setsebool -P virt_use_nfs 1

.. Run the same commands on `serverb` as it is the destination host.

 [root@serverb ~]# semanage fcontext -a -t virt_image_t '/mnt/migration-volume'
 [root@serverb ~]# restorecon -v '/mnt/migration-volume'
 [root@serverb ~]# setsebool -P virt_use_nfs 1

. Create a virtual machine on `servera`.
.. Switch to `servera` on the RHEL web console UI.
.. Create a virtual machine on `servera` which is the source host from which you migrate the VM.
... Click *Virtual machines* breadcrumb and then click *Create VM*.
+
image::6.2.png[float="center",align=center]

.. Enter the details as mentioned in the below table.
+
|===
|Name	|test-rhel

| Storage	|migration-test
| Volume	|migration-volume
| Memory	|2 GiB
|===
... Click *Create*.
+
image::6.3.png[float="center",align=center]

.. Verify that VM is in the `running` state.
+
image::6.4.png[float="center",align=center]

. Allow the required port number range on the firewall of `servera` and `serverb`.
.. Open the port range of `49152-49215` on `servera` and `serverb`. Ports `49152-49215`` are needed by QEMU for transfering the memory and disk migration data.

 [root@servera ~]# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=49152-49215/tcp
 success
 [root@servera ~]# firewall-cmd --reload
 success

 [root@serverb ~]# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=49152-49215/tcp
 success
 [root@serverb ~]# firewall-cmd --reload
 success

. Live-migrate the VM.
.. Use the Migrate option from the dropdown on selecting the three dots of the VM.
+
image::8.1.png[float="center",align=center]

.. Enter the Destination URI as `qemu+ssh://serverb/system` and click *Migrate*.
+
image::8.2.png[float="center",align=center]

.. Verify that you see the following error.
 
 Cannot recv data: Host key verification failed.: Connection reset by peer
+
image::8.3.png[float="center",align=center]

... `virsh migrate` runs the migration as the `root` user. For migration to succeed, you copy the public keys of the `root` user between `servera` and `serverb`, remember that this was a prerequisite.

. Exchange SSH keys of the root user of `servera` and `serverb`.
.. Generate a SSH key on `servera`.

 [root@servera ~]# ssh-keygen
 Generating public/private rsa key pair.
 Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa):
 Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
 Enter same passphrase again:
 Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa
 Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
 The key fingerprint is:
 ...output omitted...

.. Copy the contents of the public key file at `/root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` on `servera` and add it to `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` file in `serverb`.

.. Generate a SSH key on `serverb`.

 [root@serverb ~]# ssh-keygen
 Generating public/private rsa key pair.
 Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa):
